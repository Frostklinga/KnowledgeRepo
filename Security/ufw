# UFW (Uncomplicated FireWall) is an abstraction upon iptables, allowing easier creation and management of rules.

# Man pages http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man8/ufw.8.html

# Good to know:
# I've read that UFW applies allow established, related to outgoing connections. Therefor, you don't need to apply these rules yourself.
# UFW allows ping by default
# UFW reloads newly applied rules after entering them. No need to manually reload UFW. 
#

### Requirements
apt install ufw

# Optional: 
# Are you going to be routing or forwarding packets?
# Edit /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf
# Add:
# net/ipv4/ip_forward=1
# net/ipv6/conf/default/forwarding=1
# net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding=1
# ufw default deny forwarding
# (Set forwarding from eth0 to eth1)
# ufw route allow in on eth0 out on eth2
# or more restricted
# ufw route allow in on eth0 out on eth1 to 12.34.45.67 port 80 proto tcp
# 

# Basic syntax:
# ufw allow from CIDR to CIDR port 27017
# ufw allow out 2222 comment 'This rule needs explaination'
# 
# ufw status verbose

# Basic ruleset
# 

# Run as root or sudo!
ufw allow 22/tcp
ufw allow out 53
ufw allow out 80
ufw allow out 443

ufw default deny incoming
ufw default deny outgoing
